# serial_manipulator_forward_kinematics
A matlab code for generating the forward kinematic matrices of any serial manipulator up to 6DOF using DH method.
## How to use?
1. Run the file named kinematics.m
1. Answer the questions
	- First, enter the number of joints
	- Then, enter the type of each joint (revolute or prismatic)
	- Finaly, enter the DH parameters of each joint
1. DH parameters will be displayed as well as the DH matrix
